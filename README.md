This wikiHow teaches you how to turn a folder on your computer network into a shared drive. In order to do this, your computer must be on the same network as the computer on which the drive folder resides. You can map a network drive on both Windows and Mac computers.

## How to Map a Network Drive in Windows 11

1. Open This PC by launching File Explorer (WIN+E) and selecting This PC from the navigation pane.
2. Use the See more menu button (the three dots) at the top of the window to select Map network drive.
3. Pick a letter from the menu you want the network drive to be identified as. This can be any letter in the list.
4. Browse for, or type the path to, the shared folder the network drive should be mapped to.
5. Select Finish.
 * You might have to wait a few seconds for Windows to establish the connection, after which you can access the share like you would a flash drive or local hard drive and rename how it appears in This PC.

## How to Map a Network Drive on Mac

_Instead of downloading or copying the same data to all your devices, save the data in a single folder and then share the folder with your other devices. Once you have shared the location of this data via a UNC path, you can then map the network drive to all your devices with a few simple steps._

1. Launch Finder.
2. Click Go > Connect to Server.
3. Enter the path for the network drive you'd like to map and click Connect.
4. If you're prompted for a confirmation, click Connect.
5. Once the network drive has been mapped, it will appear under your desktop as a mounted drive or under your Locations menu in any Finder window.

## How to Automount a Network Drive on macOS

1. Click the Apple Logo > System Preferences.
2. Click Users & Groups.
3. Select the username that has access to the network drive.
4. Select the Login Items tab.
5. Navigate to the item you wish to add. Click once to select it, then click Add.

## Using Map Network Drive Utility

_The Map Network Drive utility in the file explorer has barely changed since Windows 7, and the way to use it remains mostly the same. Here are the steps to use this utility:_

1. Press Win + E and select This PC from the left pane.
2. Click on the triple-dot icon and select Map Network Drive.
3. Select a drive letter that’s not in use.
4. In the Folder box, enter the name of the computer and the folder you’re trying to access. If you don’t remember the exact values, you can use the Browse option as well.
5. Optional: You can enable the Reconnect at sign-in option to automatically connect every time you sign in. You can also enable the Connect using different credentials option to use network credentials not associated with your current account.
6. Once you’re done, press Finish.
